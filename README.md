Hello Shakepay!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I did not have time to deploy. Please clone this repository locally and run `yarn install`, then `yarn start` in the root directory.
Some notes on the project:
* I put effort into showing my approach to reusable components + css in the home page
* I ran out of time, so the wallet page is not as nicely formatted, but should be logically correct. (I am not good at accounting, but the business logic can easily be tweaked.)
* I didn't have time to calculate the balance and show it on the home screen, but given the work done I think it's clear it's within my capabilities (it correctly shows on the wallet screen).
